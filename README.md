# mixn’s Dotfiles

## Inspiration

This repo is mostly inspired and heavily influenced by

- Mathias Bynens’ [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
- Zach Holman’s [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)
- Dries Vints’ [dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles)
- Lars Kappert’s [dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles)

Not a fork of any since I wanted to build from scratch and really **only** include what I need, while improving my understanding of how things work along the way.
